# FortiGate Autoscale on AWS

The implementation for FortiGate Autoscale using [Fortinet Autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/autoscale-core) on Amazon AWS platfrom.

This project provides a multi-group Auto Scaling functionality for Fortinet FortiGate EC2 instances to form an HA cluster with failover protection.

This project has the following features:

1. Multi-group Hybrid Licensing models:
   1. **Hybrid**: 1 fix-sized Auto Scaling group of 2 (and more) BYOL FortiGate Instances, and 1 dynamically scalable Auto Scaling group of (0 or more) On-Demand FortiGate Instances.
   2. **BYOL-Only**: 1 dynamically scalable Auto Scaling group of (0 or more) BYOL FortiGate Instances.
   3. **PAYG-Only**: 1 dynamically scalable Auto Scaling group of (0 or more) On-Demand FortiGate Instances.
2. AWS Transit Gateway Integration.

## Deployment packages

  * Download the **aws-cloudformation.zip** for the latest production version from [project release page](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws/releases).
  * or, manually generate the deployment package:
